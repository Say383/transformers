dependency1==version1
dependency2==version2
dependency3==version3
...
```

Replace `dependency1`, `dependency2`, etc. with the actual names of the dependencies, and `version1`, `version2`, etc. with the desired versions of each dependency.

For example, if the required dependencies are `numpy`, `torch`, and `transformers`, the `requirements.txt` file would look like this:

```
numpy==1.19.5
torch==1.9.0
transformers==4.11.3
